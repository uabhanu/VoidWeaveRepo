## Overview

**Void Weave** is a tactical bullet-hell tower defence game where players strategically deploy autonomous turret nodes while dodging geometric enemy patterns in a minimalist sci-fi arena.

**Key Features:**
- Hybrid Gameplay: Strategic turret placement meets skill-based bullet-hell dodging
- Wave-Based Survival: Defend against increasingly complex enemy formations
- Tactical Decisions: Limited resources force meaningful deployment choices
- High-Performance ECS: Built on Unity's Entity Component System
- Geometric Aesthetic: Clean, minimalist visual design

---

## Core Concept

Players face waves of geometric enemies in a contained arena. Success requires mastering three pillars:

**DODGE** → Navigate bullet-hell patterns with precise movement and dashing

**DEPLOY** → Place turret nodes in tactical positions during preparation

**ADAPT** → React to enemy compositions and adjust strategies

---

## Game Loop

### Three-Phase Cycle

**1. PREPARATION PHASE (30 seconds)**
- Navigate the arena freely
- Deploy or relocate turret nodes
- Review enemy intel for next wave
- Spend resources on upgrades

**2. COMBAT WAVE (60+ seconds)**
- Geometric enemies spawn in patterns
- Player dodges bullet-hell attacks
- Deployed turrets engage automatically
- Collect resources from defeated enemies

**3. UPGRADE PHASE**
- Review wave performance
- Spend collected resources
- Unlock new turret types
- Upgrade existing nodes
- Difficulty scales up

Then loop back to Preparation.

## Player Mechanics

### Movement
- **WASD** - 8-directional movement (5 units/sec)
